# To-Do-List
The To-Do List application offers a robust set of features designed for efficient task management.

Users can easily input new tasks via a text field and add them to the list by clicking a button or pressing the Enter key. It also preserves the data using local storage which means users can return to their list without losing any tasks. We can also edit the unfinished saved iten so that the user can change it easily. User can mark it as Done on which completed tasks  automatically moved to the end of the list, helping users prioritize and focus on what still needs to be done. Task counts are dynamically updated to reflect current progress, providing users with instant feedback on their task management efforts.
